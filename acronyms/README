This is Script to check for acronyms in a text. It was used to scrap a Master's thesis and build an Acronym's dictionary.

The logic to find an Acronym in this script is: any word that has at least 2 uppercase letters.

The script will ask for the original filename and a new filename. 

The new file will be a list separated by comma of all acronyms found
